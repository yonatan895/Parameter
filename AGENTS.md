Always pull main(the latest branch with the latest changes) into your environment. After that, create a local branch from the existing main, work on it, and when your'e finished send a PR
This project is a twitter-clone. the code needs to be idiomatic, maintainable and optimized in terms of memory and cpu performance.
If you have any suggestions on how to make better the project that's beyond what I've asked you to do, suggest a PR and I will look into it.
Automate every part of building and testing the project to the maximum. I want minimum manual work. Think like a DevOps engineer. Things need to be easy for developers and people who would like to try the project.
Use only the latest versions of packages you know. If a package is outdated, notify about it.
When you add a feature, focus on it. Don't messs around with things which already work. 
For each feature tyou add, provide clear documentation and a comprehensive test suit to cover edge cases. If you see existing code that is not documented/tested properly, fix it.
